                <strong>Short bio</strong>: Dr. Anthony Hoogs coordinates AI activities across the company and leads Kitware’s Computer Vision Team, which he founded when he joined Kitware in 2007. For more than two decades, he has supervised and performed research in various areas of computer vision including: ethical and explainable AI; media forensics; event, activity and behavior recognition; deep learning; object detection, recognition and tracking; and content-based retrieval. He has led dozens of projects, sponsored by commercial companies and government entities including DARPA, AFRL, ONR, I-ARPA and NGA, that range from basic, academic research to developing advanced prototypes and demonstrations installed at operational facilities. He has been the overall Principal Investigator on multiple large DARPA programs, where he was responsible for overseeing collaborations with more than 25 universities and more than ten commercial subcontractors. At GE Global Research (1998-2007), Dr. Hoogs led a team of researchers in video and imagery analysis on projects sponsored by the US Government, Lockheed Martin and NBC Universal. He has served on technical panels for DARPA, NSF, NOAA and the National Academies, including DARPA Information Science and Technology (ISAT) panels in 2007, 2009 and 2013 and as an ISAT member 2018-2020. In 2019 he served as the lead organizer for an ISAT study on ethical reasoning in computational autonomy. Dr. Hoogs received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. He has published more than 80 papers in computer vision, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and remote sensing. His academic service includes General Chair and Program Chair roles for major computer vision conferences such as the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and the IEEE Winter conference on Applications of Computer Vision. He has co-organized more than ten workshops at major AI conferences. He regularly serves as an Area Chair and on program committees for the primary computer vision and AI conferences and workshops.
